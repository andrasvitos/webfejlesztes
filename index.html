                <section class="abouttext">
                    London is a city that attracts every type of visitors. From its historical buildings with
                    century-old architectural styles to its modern districts with skyscrapers the city has a lot to
                    offer and we can definately explore a strong contrast in its architecture. With its ethnically
                    diverse population of around 8.9 billion, London is the 3rd largest city in Europe. It is the U.K.'s
                    largest metropolis and its economic, transportation, and cultural centre. London is also among the
                    oldest of the world's great cities, with its history spanning nearly two millennia.

                <p>Did you know that City of London is a local governmental district of about 1 square mile in the
                    downtown of London where most of the world's leading financial institutions have buildings? This is
                    why it is the primary financial district of the capital and a leading
                    financial centre throughout the world. Definately put it in your schedule as it is an
                    unmissable location!</p>

                <h1 class="title">Christmas in Hyde Park!</h1>
                <p>The Holidays are close, and when in London, you just can't miss the largest Christmas market in the
                    UK. Held every year, the Winter Wonderland is a Christmas market and festival set in Hyde Park and
                    expects milions of visitors! A great way to put an end
                    of a long, tiring sightseeing day is by taking a last walk in the market with a hot drink in your
                    hand.

                <p>It doesn't matter if you stay for weeks, months or just a couple of days, Greenwich is just something
                    you just can't miss because of the beautiful panorama! Exceptional location to visit during a sunny
                    morning and to take pictures at the
                    Greenwich Meridian then lay out on the grass and just admire Canary Wharf views with pastry and a
                    fresh coffee!</p>
